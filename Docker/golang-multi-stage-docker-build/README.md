# Multi Stage Docker Build

The main purpose of choosing a golang based applciation to demostrate this example is golang is a statically-typed programming language that does not require a runtime in the traditional sense. Unlike dynamically-typed languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which rely on a runtime environment to execute their code, Go compiles directly to machine code, which can then be executed directly by the operating system.

So the real advantage of multi stage docker build and distro less images can be understand with a drastic decrease in the Image size.


### Advantages

Multi-stage Docker builds offer several advantages that make them a powerful and popular approach for building container images. Some of the key advantages include:

 - Smaller Image Size: Multi-stage builds allow you to create lean and efficient container images by discarding unnecessary files and build artifacts in the final image. The final image only includes the runtime components and dependencies required to run the application, resulting in smaller image sizes compared to traditional single-stage builds.

- Enhanced Security: With multi-stage builds, you can isolate the build environment from the runtime environment. This separation ensures that the final image only contains the application and its necessary runtime dependencies, reducing the attack surface and making the image more secure.

 - Faster Builds: Multi-stage builds can significantly speed up the image building process. The intermediate build stages can be cached by Docker, which means that only the changes made to the source code trigger recompilation. This can save time during the development and continuous integration (CI) processes.

 - Simplified Dockerfiles: Multi-stage builds allow you to create more maintainable Dockerfiles with a clean separation between the build instructions and the runtime configuration. This separation improves the readability and maintainability of the Dockerfile.

 - Optimized CI/CD Workflows: By using multi-stage builds, you can streamline your CI/CD workflows. You can build and test the application in one stage and then package it into a minimal and optimized runtime image in the next stage. This ensures consistency and efficiency in your deployment process.

 - Cross-Compilation Support: Multi-stage builds enable cross-compilation, where you can build the application for different target platforms in one Dockerfile. This is particularly useful when you want to build a single container image that can run on various architectures or operating systems.

- Reuse of Artifacts: The build artifacts generated in earlier stages can be reused in subsequent stages, minimizing redundant work and allowing you to share the same artifacts between different images.

- Version Control Management: Multi-stage builds provide better version control management as each stage has its defined dependencies, reducing the likelihood of version conflicts and ensuring consistency across different environments.

 - Flexibility: Multi-stage builds are versatile and can be used with various programming languages and frameworks. They are not limited to specific use cases and can be adapted to suit different application architectures.

Overall, multi-stage Docker builds enable you to create more efficient, secure, and streamlined container images, making them a valuable tool in modern containerized application development and deployment
