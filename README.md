# DevOps Practice Sets

## Overview

Welcome to the DevOps Practice Sets repository! This repository contains practice sets related to Docker, Kubernetes, Shell Scripting, and AWS VPC Designs. Below, we'll provide an in-depth guide to the contents and purpose of each folder within this repository.

## Docker

### Purpose

The `Docker` folder is dedicated to Docker-related practice sets. Here, you'll find exercises and resources to help you become proficient in Docker, including working with Docker volumes, containerizing applications, multi-stage builds, and Docker Compose files.

### Contents

- **Volumes**: Practice working with Docker volumes, understanding how data persistence works, and configuring volume mounts.

- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Explore the concept of multi-stage builds in Docker to create efficient and lightweight Docker images.

- **Docker Compose**: Gain experience with Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

## Kubernetes

### Purpose

The `Kubernetes` folder is designed to help you practice Kubernetes concepts and manifests. Kubernetes is a crucial tool for container orchestration, and here you'll find exercises related to deployments, namespaces, pods, and services.

### Contents

- **Deployments**: Practice creating Kubernetes deployments, managing rolling updates, and scaling your applications.

- **Namespaces**: Learn how to use Kubernetes namespaces to organize and isolate resources within a cluster.

- **Pods**: Explore Kubernetes pods and understand how to create, manage, and troubleshoot them.

- **Services**: Gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes services, which provide networking and load balancing for your applications.

## Shell Scripting

### Purpose

The `Shell Scripting` folder contains practice problems aimed at helping you master the syntax and capabilities of shell scripting. Shell scripts are essential for automating tasks in DevOps workflows.

### Contents

- **Syntax Practice**: Sharpen your skills by working through practice problems that cover shell script syntax, variables, and control structures.

- **Automation Tasks**: Learn how to automate common DevOps tasks using shell scripts, making your workflows more efficient and reproducible.

## AWS VPC Designs

### Purpose

The `AWS VPC Designs` folder focuses on AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) designs and configurations. You'll find practice exercises related to NAT Gateways, VPC Peering, and other networking concepts in AWS.

### Contents

- **NAT Gateway Designs**: Practice creating AWS VPC designs that incorporate Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways for secure outbound traffic from private subnets.

- **VPC Peering Scenarios**: Explore VPC peering scenarios and design VPC architectures that facilitate secure communication between isolated network environments.
